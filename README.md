## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- BEM architecture
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

- I learned that in order to change the default font size you'd have to target the html tag instead of simply declaring it at the body tag.


### Useful resources

- [A complete guide to CSS Grid | CSS-TRICKS](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) : This article has divided properties into two sections based on what goes on grid-container (parent) and grid-items (child) with descriptive diagrams and code snippets which helped me understand well. I'd recommend to anyone interested in learning grid layout.

- [Layering box shadows | Tobias Ahlin](https://tobiasahlin.com/blog/layered-smooth-box-shadows/) : A very interesting article that talks about different ways to layer box shadows.
